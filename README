This is the gem5 simulator.

The main website can be found at http://www.gem5.org

A good starting point is http://www.gem5.org/Introduction, and for
more information about building the simulator and getting started
please see http://www.gem5.org/Documentation and
http://www.gem5.org/Tutorials.

To build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,
Python (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, SWIG, zlib, m4,
and lastly protobuf if you want trace capture and playback
support. Please see http://www.gem5.org/Dependencies for more details
concerning the minimum versions of the aforementioned tools.

Once you have all dependencies resolved, type 'scons
build/<ARCH>/gem5.opt' where ARCH is one of ALPHA, ARM, NULL, MIPS,
POWER, SPARC, or X86. This will build an optimized version of the gem5
binary (gem5.opt) for the the specified architecture. See
http://www.gem5.org/Build_System for more details and options.

With the simulator built, have a look at
http://www.gem5.org/Running_gem5 for more information on how to use
gem5.

The basic source release includes these subdirectories:
   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5
   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator
   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems
   - tests: regression tests
   - util: useful utility programs and files

To run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware
(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk
images. Please see the gem5 download page for these items at
http://www.gem5.org/Download

If you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org

Enjoy using gem5 and please share your modifications and extensions.

Comments:
1) In order to run the simulation the file "my_scripts/GTRocket_hammer.sh" needs to be run with the correct benchmark name. 
For example, if we wish to run perlbench then in command line we would do "./my_scripts/GTRocket_hammer.sh perlbench".

The GTRocket_hammer.sh already contains the SPEC benchmark commands and their inputs. All we need to do is install SPEC 
somewhere in our directory structure preferrably outside the gem5 repo. The path can be seen at the top of the
GTRocket_hammer.sh script.

2) All the configurations are at the bottom of the file. The only important configurations are:
	a) sni=0/1 <- This enables the SNIs at the interposer link boundary.
	b) vcs-per-vnet <- Configuration for number of virtual channels per vnet
	
3) In order to run the sni enabled configuration two things need to be done:
	a) sni=1 in the GTRocket_hammer script
	b) In the file src/mem/ruby/network/garnet/NetworkInterface.cc; there is a configuration:
	
	if(p->id == 64 || p->id == 65 || p->id == 66 || p->id == 67){
        enSNI=true;
		//enSNI=false;
		
	We need to comment/uncomment the code with enSNI=true to enable the SNIs at the MC<->interposer boundary.
	Unfortunately, it was difficult to link this with "sni" param in GTRocket_hammer script due to pointer conflicts.
	This was the lazy/easy way out.
	
	c) Now after this, gem5 needs to be rebuild for the change to take effect. Use the following command:
	 scons build/X86_MOESI_hammer/gem5.opt SLICC_HTML=True -j4

Tip:- The best way that I could think of two run the SNI enabled and disabled configurations is to have two gem5 repo. One with SNI enabled and the
other with disabled build. And then run the simulations parallely.
